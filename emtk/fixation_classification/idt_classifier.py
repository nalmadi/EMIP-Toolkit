        https://psychologie.unibas.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/psychologie/Forschung/N-Lab/SMI_iView_X_Manual.pdf

        Notes:
            remember that some data is MSG for mouse clicks.
            some records are invalid with value -1.
            read right eye data only.

    Parameters
    ----------
    raw_fixations : list
        a list of fixations information containing timestamp, x_cord, and y_cord

    minimum_duration : int, optional
        minimum duration for a fixation in milliseconds, less than minimum is considered noise.
        set to 50 milliseconds by default

    sample_duration : int, optional
        Sample duration in milliseconds, this is 4 milliseconds based on this eye tracker

    maximum_dispersion : int, optional
        maximum distance from a group of samples to be considered a single fixation.
        Set to 25 pixels by default

    Returns
    -------
    list
        a list where each element is a list of timestamp, duration, x_cord, and y_cord
